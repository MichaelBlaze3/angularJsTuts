## What is AngularJS?
AngularJS is a JavaScript framework designed for creating Single Page Applications(SPA) mainly maintained by Google.

## Model View viewModel
Its intent is to provide a clean separation of **concerns** between the user interface controls and their logic. 

There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the Model, the View, and the view model. 

The components are decouple from each other, this allows us to: 

* Change the internal implementation without affecting the others.
* Work with each component independently.
* Isolate unit testing.
