# AngularJS - Controllers

## The Role of a Controller
The task of a controller is to augment the scope by attaching models and functions to it that are subsequently accesed by the view.

A controller is nothing but a constructor function which is instantiated by AngularJS when it encounters **ng-controller** directive in HTML.
