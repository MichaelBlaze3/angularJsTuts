# AngularJS - Routing - UI Router

For this section, we will use a 3rd party routing framework called `AngularUI Router`, which allows us to organize the parts of your interface into a `state machine`. Unlike the **$route service** in the angular ngRoute module, which is organized around URL routes, UI-Router is organized around `states`, which may optionally have routes, as well as other behavior, attached.

States are bound to named, nested and parallel views, allowing you to powerfully manage your application's interface.
