# AngularJS - Services
AngularJS services are subtitutable objects that are wired together using `dependency injection`. You can use services to organize and share code across your app.

AngularJS services are:
* Lazily instantiated - AngularJS only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
* Singletons - Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory.

AngularJS provide serveral useful services, but for most applications you'll also want to create your own.

## How to use a Service
To use an AngularJS service, you need to add it as a dependency for the component(controller, service, filter or directive) that depends on the service. AngularJS's `dependecy injection` subsystem takes care of the rest.

Here is an example implementing a service:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>How to use a service?</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div ng-controller="MyController">
            <h1>Notification service</h1>
            <input ng-init="message='test' " ng-model="message">
            <button ng-click="callNotify(message);">Notify</button>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
```javascript
(function(){
    angular
        .module('myServiceModule', [])
        .controller('MyController', [`$scope`, `notify`, function(){
            $scope.callNotify = function(msg){
                notify(msg);
            };
        }])
        .factory('notify', ['$window', function($window){
            var msgs = [];
            return function(msg){
                msgs.push(msg);
                if(msgs.length === 3){
                    $window.alert(msgs.join('\n'));
                    msgd = []; d
                }
            }
        }]);
})();
```
